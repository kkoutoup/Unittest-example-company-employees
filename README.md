# Unittest Example - Company Employees

## Description
A simple script that adds employees to a fictional company database with their details (first, last name etc) and produces email accounts and pay rise calculations

## Purpose
Familiarising myself with Python's unittest library

## File structure
Main file `company.py` that is being tested with `test_employee_class.py` and `test_manager_sub_class.py`
```

|
test_employee_class.py
test_manager_sub_class.py
```

## Dependencies
